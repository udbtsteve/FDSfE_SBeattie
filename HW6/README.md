This folder is for Homework 6 materials, including responses.

Update: due initially to poor work prioritization (prioritizing term project too heavily), and then by family 'emergencies' (notably a baby delivery 'scare', and both son and pregnant wife being sick at the same time) I started the assignment too late. When I finally started, I read the first few lines of the assignment and concluded that my time might be better-spent squaring away my term project results more fully before the actual baby delivery happens (expected in the next ~2 weeks).
