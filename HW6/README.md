This folder is for Homework 6 materials, including responses.

Update: due initially to poor work prioritization (prioritizing term project too heavily), and then later due to family 'emergencies' (notably a baby delivery 'scare', and extra 'home work' due to both son and pregnant wife being sick at the same time) I started the assignment too late -- on Monday morning (11/28), in fact, to be honest. When I finally started, I read the first few lines of the assignment (advice on not waiting until the last minute to start) and concluded that my time might be better-spent squaring away my term project results more fully before the actual baby delivery happens (expected in the next ~2 weeks), rather than struggling to quickly begin and complete an already-late assignment, to the potential detriment of the project report. For the remaining assignments, I will be sure to start as soon as the assignments are released -- not that it's relevant here, necessarily.
