*** Hyperparameter tuning methodology for household agents on the LEM-DIS platform... ***

... Which is a NetLogo-based platform for virtual microgrid energy market simulation and mechanism design impact analysis (described in Beattie et al, 2022). 

The household agents utilize the Modified Roth-Erev reinforcement learning algorithm described in (Nicolaisen et al, 2001), which built on (Roth, Erev 1998). In the latter work, Alvin Roth describes a rational, interpretable, and empirically-validated approach to reproducing the learning trends and outcomes of individual utility-maximizing auction market participants. The learning approach is expanded on by Nicolaisen et al. to include parameters for both outcome memory (lambda) and learning rate (epsilon).
