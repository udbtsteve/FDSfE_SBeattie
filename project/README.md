The household agents utilize the Modified Roth-Erev reinforcement learning algorithm described in (Nicolaisen et al, 2001), which built on (Roth, Erev 1998). In the latter work, Alvin Roth describes a rational, interpretable, and empirically-validated approach to reproducing the learning trends and outcomes of individual utility-maximizing auction market participants. The learning approach is expanded on by Nicolaisen et al. to include parameters for both outcome memory (lambda) and learning rate (epsilon).
