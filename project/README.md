LEM-DIS: A NetLogo-based platform for virtual microgrid energy market simulation and mechanism design impact analysis. The platform is still under development, but a recent progress 'snapshot' can be found in (Beattie et al. 2022).


Household 'user-agents' simulated on the platform utilize the Modified Roth-Erev reinforcement learning algorithm described in (Nicolaisen et al, 2001), which built on (Roth, Erev 1998). In the latter work, Alvin Roth describes a rational, interpretable, and empirically-validated approach to reproducing the learning trends and outcomes of individual utility-maximizing auction market participants. The learning approach is expanded on by Nicolaisen et al. to include parameters for both outcome memory (lambda) and learning rate (epsilon).
