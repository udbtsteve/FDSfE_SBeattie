# HW3 Responses

This homework assignment provides an introduction to exploratory data analysis in Python using basic descriptive statistics. Data on public park sizes in the city of Philadelphia, PA (U.S.) are used in the analysis, which is largely focused on the frequency distribution of park sizes.

The responses provided here were produced by myself, without group-mates. Accordingly, I am responsible for the full content of the answers. The notebook itself, including formatting and non-response contents, was initially developed by Dr. Federica Bianco, University of Delaware.
